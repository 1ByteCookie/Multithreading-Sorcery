dont know why, but it seems std::thread can only recognize
a limited amount of types.

when i tried to pass a player struct as parameter for a thread,
it breaks, and cant recognize the type.


there's probably a better way to do this, but the idea,
is to pass whatever parameter as a void* and then
type cast that pointer to the desired type.

this looks unsafe, the best i've got for now...
